          <p>Welcome to my personal music page! I'm a passionate music lover who enjoys curating playlists, exploring new genres, and designing pages that reflect my vibe. From alternative pop to lo-fi beats, music is how I express myself and connect with the world.</p>
          <p>When I’m not discovering new artists or geeking out over album visuals, I enjoy coding creative websites like this one. This project combines both of my favorite things — design + music — in a way that’s personal and fun. Hope you enjoy exploring!</p>
